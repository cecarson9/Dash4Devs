# Dash4Devs

Dash4Devs is an idea that came about while job hunting. The last two years of my career I've been working on a legacy application doing mostly OracleDB PL/SQL work, and I've realized that I do not have the experience in modern technologies that employers are looking, and I would need to create some projects on my own while also improving my critical thinking and problem solving skills as a developer.

That's where Dash4Devs comes in. Dash4Devs is meant to be an all-in-one dashboard focused on continuous learning and bettering yourself as a software developer. This a project that I plan to continously improve over time even after initial deployment.

Dash4Devs is made using the MERN stack with React + Vite and TailwindCSS v4.
